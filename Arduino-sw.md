# Ardunio Software

One goal was to reduce software stacks which is why the input-only controls are HID and configured in MSFS.  ChatGPT wrote those the software software, itâ€™s a marvelous tool for handling details and learning.

With FS2024 I may use MobiFlight or spad.next to better map and maintain.

## Three Arduinos cover all input-only controls using the Joystick library.  The project includes code for each:
* Arduino Pro Throttle, Switch, TOGA, Carb Heat
* Arduino Micro Pro Trim and Flaps
* Arduino Micro Pro Parking Brake, Key/Start, Fuel Selector, and Rudder Trim
