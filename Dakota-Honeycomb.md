# Dakota Sim with Honeycomb

In late summer of 2023 we bought a share of a PA-28-235 so I had a specific plane to target.  This second generation sim was a big upgrade to build a dedicated sim and recover my office desk.  It includes avionics to match our glass upgrade in the real-life plane. 

The heart of our new panel is a Garmin G3X and no X-Plane version is available so I moved to Microsoft and Windows. 

Details that are distinct from this older version may help those using standard Honeycomb throttle/yoke panels.
