This major upgrade was the excuse needed to upgrade my shop with these tools:

$6800 [Onefinity Foreman](https://www.onefinitycnc.com/product-page/elite-series-foreman-48-x48-cut-area) 4’x4’ CNC, [PwCNC spindle](https://pwncnc.com/products/spindle), [44W laser](https://www.onefinitycnc.com/product-page/onefinity-j-tech-44w-octo-pro-laser-worlds-most-powerful-diode-laser?srsltid=AfmBOopGufngTNv-cUjM_GAhFoQU9pXaj6fKd-8jtoIqrSAce5fQOECW), and dust boot

$950 [FlexiSpot E7Q](https://www.flexispot.com/flexispot-odin-4-leg-standing-desk) 4-leg standing to park my CNC above my planner and joiner

$840 [Bambu P1P](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/p1p) 3D printer, enclosure upgrade (order mistake, they would not exchange)

I replaced the panel, table, yoke, throttle, rudder pedals and radio.  I don’t need all the Air Manager monitors nor the Air Manager computer.  I’m using all the instruments and especially design and layout lessons from the prior panel.

You can see the total products and prices used and build details in the main section above.
