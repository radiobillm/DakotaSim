# Center Stack Controls

![name](images/center-column.jpg)

A bolted support box under the table houses:

✔ Parking Brake

✔ Fuel Selector Switch

✔ Rudder Trim

✔ Arduino Pro (which also controls the key switch)

Due to the limitations of my 255mm 3D printer bed, the column is built from two stacked boxes. The parking brake is mounted to the ceiling of the lower box.

However, the top box is too small to allow easy internal access. A better approach would be to side-mount the brake and leave an open column for easier maintenance.

The Arduino is floating with no mount, it also controls the key switch.

## Parking Brake 

Edited:

I ordered the SimWales Parking Brake (designed for a Cessna 172) from caspajack on eBay, and it works well.

However, Parking Brake On and Off controls do not function correctly in either the Cessna 172 or RV-10. As a workaround, I mapped the Off control to Parking Brake Toggle for reliable operation.

The brake main rod stop was removed to remove the faceplate.  Be careful when rotating the brake assembly to preserve normally in and brake-off horizontal, vs pull and rotate brake-on vertical.  The switch pin can be flipped to an alternate hole.

## Fuel Selector 

The Fuel Selector switch is simply a trim piece over a 5-selector switch.  

On a real Piper PA-28-235, the fuel selector is located on the center firewall and has five fuel positions:

1. Off
2. Left Tip
3. Left Main
4. Right Main
5. Right Tip

I was unable to find any published designs for the plastic trim piece, nor could I find an MSFS Dakota or any PA-28 with a four-tank configuration.

## Rudder Trim

The rudder trim uses a potentiometer identical to those used for the throttle levers. It is mounted with a custom-printed bracket for the center column.
