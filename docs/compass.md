# Compass

The whiskey-style Compass was purchased from SimWales (via caspajack on eBay), and it looks fantastic.

Mobiflight controls the compass, I had to adjust the suggested settings to use a Display Scale of 9000 and Transform $ * (-12.5).  The compass is powered with a USB 5V USB cable.

The compass stepper controller and ardunio are contained within a printed box that also holds the dimmer module.
