#Monitors and Sound

## Main Monitors

Since I was already happy with a previous model, I upgraded to Samsung’s 49” Ultrawide Odyssey G9 as my center monitor, paired with two Samsung 27” side monitors.  

## Monitor Stand

The SimFab Triple Mount monitor stand is beefy and good without angled front but without side stands. Vertically aligning side monitors took all the adjustment available and then some to match the ultrawide center screen.

All three monitors use HDMI on the monitor connected to one HDMI and two DP ports with adapters on the 4080 card.  For some reason, the ultrawide monitor’s DisplayPort connection was not recognized, and after spending too much time troubleshooting, I gave up and used HDMI instead.  Also, I goofed by buying an Intel i9 processor without graphics.  

## Panel Monitors

The panel includes six monitors, all powered through a USB-to-HDMI adapter:

* RealSimGear G500, GTN, and G5
* A low-mounted display for Manifold and Tach gauges powered by USB-C
* A right-side monitor for the JPI Engine Monitor and Transponder

This setup mostly works well, but occasionally Windows 10 forgets the display arrangement or loses touchscreen functionality.  

In an earlier setup, I had nine total displays, but Windows 10 frequently dropped them from the configuration. To fix this, I added a dedicated mini PC to handle Air Manager instruments. Now that I’ve reduced the number of displays, the mini PC is no longer necessary.

## Sound

A Sonos Beam works well using a USB-TOSLink-HDMI connection.  The beam rest on L brackets fabricated to hang from the monitor stand.
