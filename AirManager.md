## Air Manager

I purchased a copy of Air Manager two years ago for my first desktop sim and itâ€™s the only component still used from that era, it's been reliable and a fun tool.  My current panel also has a knobster, unused now but available later.

The $25 Air Manager G5 was the best I found, more realistic than Asobo and without the pop-out hassles.  I use a JPI from the community ![name](images/lookup source].  SIM Innovations makes Air Manager and has good instructions for using the RealSimGear bezel controls.

I created my own instruments below.  The radio has been replaced with a much better hardware version.  I still use my Manifold and Tach gauges .
